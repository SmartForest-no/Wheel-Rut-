# wheel-Rut-semantic-segmentation

This repo includes the scripts to replicate the methods developed in [Bhatnagar et al. (2022)](https://zenodo.org/record/5746878#.YoeAzKhBxaQ) to perform a semantic segmentation of wheel-ruts caused by forestry machinery based on drone RGB imagery ðŸ“·.

# Installation

```
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/SmartForest-no/wheelRuts_semanticSegmentation
cd wheelRuts_semanticSegmentation

# create new environment
conda env create -f environment_cnn_wheelRuts.yaml

# activate the created environment
conda activate wheelRuts

# install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
In addition:
- Download model weights and json file at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1byb7jcAPiB9pr2gunJCbec7fRiwzI6BG?usp=sharing
- Unzip the two files and and place them in the model folder

# Usage
## Input
The algorithm takes as input one orthomosaic or a folder with several orthomosaics and

## Output

## How to run
To run the segmentation on a new drone orthomosaic
